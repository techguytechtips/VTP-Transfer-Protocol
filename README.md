# VTP

## About
VTP Transfer Protocol is a program to transfer files between a client and server.
VTP is written in pure C and is Linux only.

## Note
I made VTP to practice C and you are better off using SFTP for more secure file transfer.

VTP is useful in certain situations where you can't really get SFTP or FTP onto the device for some reason.
